Recovered low-quality or degraded images by using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with an optimization algorithm to restore lost contain and enhance resolution. Implemented the project in Python using only NumPy.

This project was conducted as part of the Machine Learning course in the 4th year at the University of Patras.
